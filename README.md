# DIRECTORY-MANAGEMENT

Directory management constitutes the functions dealing with organization and maintenance of various directories. 
Directories usually contain files of any type, but this may vary between file systems. 
The content of a directory does not affect the directory object itself  Some of the directory functions are: 
 • Navigation  
 • Absolute/ Relative Pathnames  
 • Listing Directories  
 • Creating Directories 
 • Modifying Directories 

Directory management is required in order to save space in the operating system and it not just saves space but also increases security also making easy retrieval of data from the system due to well organized directories it is easier to find the required files.  
A directory is a file the solo job of which is to store the file names and the related information. All the files, whether ordinary, special, or directory, are contained in directories. 
Unix uses a hierarchical structure for organizing files and directories. This structure is often referred to as a directory tree. The tree has a single root node, the slash character (/), and all other directories are contained below it. 
As we work in an organization using well organized directories may also result in better collaboration within the organization it also helps in backup and disaster recoveries
